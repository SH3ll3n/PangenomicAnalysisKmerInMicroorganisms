# Pangenomic analysis of k-mer in microorganisms

# What is it
Pangenomic analysis of k-mer in microorganisms is a tool for an educational university project 
to analyze the k-mer content of populations of microorganisms (by microorganisms we mean viruses, 
bacteria and protozoa).

# How to install
For installation you need to have installed jupyter-notebook. With Linux it works without problems,
with Windows you install a PowerShell (Ubuntu on Windows, version 18
o 20). 
To download the sequences of the microorganisms, you can search online databases (eg.
NCBI). This is an example of what the files look like once downloaded:

```

```

# How to use
Jupyter-notebook is launched with the command on shell:

```jupyter-notebook```

Inside "project" file there is the main project, while inside "mialibreria" there are some pre-established functions.
